        "Option 3 is the correct answer. To achieve your service level objective (SLO), which is the number of users you should acquire, you need to improve service quality, conduct marketing, and advertise. And the error budget is an indicator of \"the acceptable extent to which the reliability of the service is compromised.\" If this error budget is not exhausted, you are expected to prioritize the release of new features over system stability. Therefore, it is important to increase the \"speed at which new features are released\" in the option to acquire new users.\nOption 1 is incorrect. Multi-region configurations to increase uptime are a response to prioritizing system stability.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Streamlining application development using AI may be necessary for new feature releases, but the use of AI is not essential for new function development. AI should be used according to the application.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Redundancy to prevent downtime is a response to prioritizing system stability.\n[Reference]\nHow Maintenance Windows Affect Error Budgets - SRE Tips | Google Cloud Official Blog\nEliminating Overuse of Error Budgets: What CRE Learned in the Field (Part II) | Google Cloud Official Blog",
        "Option 4 is the correct answer. Cloud SQL is a fully managed relational database service that allows you to use the commonly used SQL engines MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server on Google Cloud. It integrates with Google Cloud services such as GKE and BigQuery and existing apps, and can perform high-performance data analysis by directly executing BigQuery queries on data in Cloud SQL.\nOption 1 is incorrect. NoSQL databases are ideal for analyzing real-time streaming data.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Cloud SQL is a relational database for structured data, so it cannot analyze unstructured data.\nOption 3 is incorrect. Cloud SQL does not support the creation of predictive models using machine learning models. You need to use Tensor Flow, for example.\n[Reference]\nCloud SQL for PostgreSQL\u3001Cloud SQL for MySQL\u3001Cloud SQL for SQL Server | Cloud SQL: Relational Database Services | Google Cloud",
        "Option 2 is the correct answer. SRE best practices require incremental changes when updating application versions. Therefore, it is necessary to initially test the new feature with a subset of customers before moving it to production.\nSite reliability engineering (SRE) is a method in which engineers on the development side participate in the operation of large-scale and complex systems to ensure stability. SRE applies development engineering best practices to operational issues to ensure efficient operations.\nOptions 1, 3 and 4 are incorrect. Rolling out new features to all customers at once and launching services is against SRE best practices for implementing incremental changes. Even with sufficient bug verification, it is difficult to eliminate 100% bugs, and a gradual migration is required.\n[Reference]\nSite Reliability Engineering (SRE) | Google Cloud\nSite Reliability Engineering (SRE) Guide | Google Cloud",
        "Option 3 is the correct answer. To prepare for a data breach, it's important to create an incident plan to mitigate the impact in advance. Google Cloud users are responsible for setting access permissions to usage data and creating an incident plan in the event of a data breach.\nSecuring the cloud requires a collaborative relationship between vendors and users. It typically operates in a shared responsibility model where the cloud provider is responsible for the security of the underlying cloud infrastructure and the security of the applications that users deploy on the cloud.\nOption 1 is incorrect. Instead of discussing security measures with cloud vendors and responding jointly, management responsibilities on the vendor and user sides are defined based on a shared responsibility model.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Data center security monitoring is Google's responsibility.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Data security is not left to Google's experts, but is responsible for the security of the applications that users deploy on the cloud.\n[Reference]\nGoogle Cloud Security Overview | Google Cloud Official Blog",
        "Option 1 is the correct answer. Public cloud services give users the flexibility to change system costs from capital expenditures (CapEx) to operational expenditures (OpEx). For example, the cost of equipment such as a data center to purchase physical servers is a capital expenditure. However, by starting a virtual server on Google Cloud, you can use the server as a service on a pay-as-you-go basis. This makes it possible to convert capital expenditures into operational expenditures.",
        "Option 2 is the correct answer. SLA stands for Service Level Agreement and is an agreement between a service provider and a user. Clearly state the level of service quality guaranteed by the Service Provider to the User. In this way, we make an agreement with the user what quality of service the service provider will guarantee, and how to solve the problem if it does not reach it. The SLA for a cloud service is calculated based on the availability of the service to continue to be successfully used. And availability is calculated by the utilization rate of the service.\n[Reference]\nDatastore Service Level Agreement (SLA) | Google Cloud",
        "Option 1 is the correct answer. By increasing the time to respond to inquiries from customers, we can provide more stable services to users. The longer you respond to customer inquiries, the more immediate you can respond to problems with the services you use.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Extending customer support inquiry response times does not mean that users can use the service for free. Different measures such as distributing free coupons are required.\nOption 3 is incorrect. Extending customer support inquiry response times doesn't mean you can keep up with the exponential increase in the number of users. Due to the limited number of existing personnel, it is necessary to increase the number of support center personnel.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Extending customer support inquiry response times does not mean that we can provide customized services for users. We need a mechanism such as recommendations that can make proposals tailored to the user.",
        "Option 1 is the correct answer. HAVE THE USER WEAR AN IOT DEVICE THAT TRANSMITS BODY DATA IN REAL TIME AND AUTOMATICALLY ACQUIRE BODY DATA. This allows you to analyze the timely health of your users over time. This will be the most effective method.\nOption 2 is incorrect. If you use a document that allows users to describe their own health data, the description and submission is left to the user, which reduces the accuracy and efficiency of data acquisition.\nOption 3 is incorrect. Smartphone applications that allow users to enter their own health data are left to the user, so the disadvantage is that there is a lot of user effort.\nOption 4 is incorrect. When a sensor camera is placed, it is possible to acquire user behavior data and body temperature by infrared rays, but it is insufficient to acquire body data. In addition, there is concern that it will be difficult to install from the viewpoint of personal information.",
        "Option 2 is the correct answer. When a \"mislabeled\" dataset is used to generate a predictive model using machine learning, the model extracts incorrect features. Features are data related to outcomes extracted by a predictive model. Therefore, this reduces the accuracy score of the prediction results.\nOptions 1 and 3 are incorrect. A dataset that is \"mislabeled\" does not increase or decrease the training time of the model. The training time of the model increases or decreases depending on the amount of data to be trained, the type of model, and the server performance used for training.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Creating a predictive model using a \"mislabeled\" dataset reduces the accuracy score of the prediction results.",
        "Option 3 is the correct answer. The advantage of storing data in Google Cloud is that you can store it almost indefinitely. You can use cloud services to flexibly store data on demand. Cloud Storage can store an unlimited amount of data, and you can retrieve the stored data as many times as you want.\nOption 1 is incorrect. Google Cloud does not provide services that can work with data from all over the world.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Google Cloud storage has a data integrity model, which ensures consistency when data is stored and updated. However, this consistency guarantee is implemented as a standard feature when processing data in databases and storage. It does not verify data integrity for specific data.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Long-term storage of data by using archival storage is also feasible in an on-premises environment. It is not a cloud-specific service.\n[Reference]\nCloud Storage | Google Cloud",

Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a method in which engineers on the development side participate in the operation of large-scale and complex systems to ensure stability. SRE applies development engineering best practices to operational issues to ensure efficient operations. Based on SRE best practices, it is important to prevent recurrence of a bug by documenting the cause and resolution of the bug and sharing it among development and operation members.\nOption 1 is incorrect. Rather than changing the engineer who was in charge of the bug, SRE requires development engineers and operations personnel to work together.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Rather than delegating authority so that small bugs can be addressed at the field level, work together as a team.\nOption 3 is incorrect. Conducting penetration testing in advance is important for prevention, but it is not the best way to respond to bugs when they occur.\n[Reference]\nSite Reliability Engineering (SRE) Guide | Google Cloud",
        "Option 1 is the correct answer. With Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you can classify applications by containerizing, allowing you to deploy and upgrade them individually, minimizing downtime when updating applications.\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is an open-source Kubernetes-powered container orchestration service. When you build an application with GKE, you can choose from a variety of deployment strategies. Among them, by using rolling updates, you can deploy new versions so that downtime does not occur by updating them little by little sequentially, without stopping the running service.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Compute Engine is a service that launches virtual machines (VMs) provided by Google Cloud. Downtime occurs when updating applications on virtual machines.\nOption 3 is incorrect. A hypervisor is software for virtualizing physical servers. You can create virtual machines on physical servers. Downtime occurs when updating applications on virtual machines.\nOption 4 is incorrect. GPUs are high-performance integrated circuits for machine learning and gaming.\n[Reference]\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Developer's Guide | Google Cloud Official Blog",
        "Option 2 is the correct answer. Giving users access to only the cloud resources they need is called the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege is a security principle that grants only the privileges necessary for a user account to that user. It has become a best practice when using the cloud.\n[Reference]\nAchieving Least Privilege by Applying IAM Recommendations in Bulk | Google Cloud Official Blog",
        "Option 2 is the correct answer. A cyberattack that asks you to enter your bank account and PIN from a suspicious email address is called phishing. Phishing is a fraudulent practice that steals personal information such as credit card numbers through fake emails or fake websites.\nOption 1 is incorrect. DDoS attack is the act of causing a system down by puncturing the server process by sending a large number of requests from multiple computers to the target website or server.\nOption 3 is incorrect. A Trojan horse is a malicious program called malware that steals sensitive information such as customer information and account numbers.\nOption 4 is incorrect. SQL injection is an attack that illegally retrieves data by exploiting a defect such as SQL code in database processing to cause an application to execute SQL statements that are not expected.",
        "Option 2 is correct. App Engine can monitor app health and performance with Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging. Cloud debugger and Error Reporting help you diagnose and fix bugs quickly.\nOption 3 is the correct answer. App Engine allows you to serve different versions of your application to specific users. This allows you to deploy the new version only to user verifiers and perform validation before the production release.\nApp Engine is a PaaS solution that provides a web application development environment and hosting location. Node .js a managed application development environment that uses Java, Ruby, C#, Go, Python, or PHP.\nBy using the version control function of App Engine, you can publish over time while checking the error status of new versions, and conduct A/B tests between versions.\nOption 1 is incorrect. App Engine is a PaaS solution that provides a development environment and hosting location for web applications, and cannot be used for services such as arranging users for application validation.\nOption 4 is incorrect. You can't just isolate new features in your application and provide them to users. App Engine can provide different versions of your application for each user.\n[Reference]\nUltimate App Engine Quick Reference | Google Cloud Official Blog",
        "Option 4 is the correct answer. When data is stored in Cloud Storage, it is automatically encrypted by default, so there is no need for you to take any action. For encryption, Cloud Storage also encrypts data server-side using standard Google-managed encryption keys or the Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS).\nOption 1 is incorrect. When you store data in Cloud Storage, it is automatically encrypted by default, and it is optional to specify the encryption key to use and encrypt it.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Cloud Storage encrypts the entire bucket instead of specifying what data is encrypted.\nOption 3 is incorrect. By default, Cloud Storage also automatically encrypts communications at rest at rest.\n[Reference]\nWhat's New in Encryption: What's New in Cloud Storage Security | Google Cloud Official Blog\nWhat you need to know about Cloud Storage | Google Cloud Official Blog",
        "Option 1 is the correct answer. A data lake is a synonym for storage or database that stores large amounts of data. In addition to structured data, data lakes cover all data, including semi-structured and unstructured data. Therefore, data lakes allow structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data to be stored together in the same repository in their raw form.\nOption 2 is incorrect. A relational database is a database that has a relational relationship between data. Stores structured data in a format predefined by the schema.\nOption 3 is incorrect. A data warehouse is a relational database that accumulates a large amount of data from multiple business systems in a company in time series and performs data analysis. You can manage structured data and then analyze it to extract insights.\nOption 4 is incorrect. A NoSQL database is a database that stores unstructured data that is not predefined by a schema or semi-structured data such as JSON. Since it mainly uses operating languages other than SQL, it is called a NoSQL database.",
        "Option 2 is the correct answer. Scaling on-premises infrastructure requires the time and cost of procuring physical resources. In that case, it is necessary to carry out procedures such as \"make a plan, carry out procurement, adjust the server installation schedule, and implement the introduction on a day that is not affected by Saturdays and Sundays\", which requires time and effort.\nOn the other hand, by using the cloud, cloud resources can be used dynamically and by the required amount on demand as the system grows. The cloud is an advantage compared to on-premises environments because services can be started and stopped at any time according to needs.\nOption 1 is incorrect. The ability for users to manage compute resources for scaling is a benefit of on-premises environments.\nOption 3 is incorrect. It's not that you can't realize serverless applications in an on-premises environment. By configuring a private cloud space in an on-premises environment, it is also possible to build a serverless platform in-house.\nOption 4 is incorrect. You don't need to work on physical infrastructure maintenance if you're using the public cloud.",
        "Option 2 is the correct answer. In the public cloud, a shared responsibility model requires that security responsibilities be shared between users and vendors. In Google Cloud, Google is responsible for managing all physical hardware. Therefore, in the event of a failure of the hardware servers, it is the responsibility of Google to replace them if necessary. Replacing physical servers and applying physical server security patches are within the scope of management that should be performed on the data center side, so they cannot be performed by the user.\nOption 1 is incorrect. When using a virtual machine, the user is required to update the guest OS.\nOption 3 is incorrect. When using a license using a virtual machine, the license cost is borne by the user.\nOption 4 is incorrect. When using a virtual machine, it is necessary for the user to manage higher-level software from the guest OS of the virtual machine, so operation personnel are required.",
        "Option 4 is the correct answer. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a container orchestration service that provides containerized computing resources and application development environments powered by open source Kubernetes. GKE provides a containerized application building environment for efficient deployment, management, and scaling.\nWhen deploying an application with GKE, you can choose from a variety of deployment strategies. Among them, by using rolling updates, you can update them sequentially little by little without stopping the running services. This allows you to deploy a new version of the application while it is running without any downtime.\nOption 1 is incorrect. When setting up a container environment using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), it is not possible to set it automatically, but it is necessary to define the container environment on the user side.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides managed infrastructure management such as servers that provide containers, but the operation management of applications developed by users on containers must be performed by the user.\nOption 3 is incorrect. To run applications in code alone, without server configuration, you need to use serverless computing such as Cloud Functions.\n[Reference]\nKubernetes - Google Kubernetes Engine\uff08GKE\uff09 | Google Cloud",
        "Option 4 is the correct answer. Google Kubernetes Engine enables you to quickly deploy and test applications using containerized compute engines. Virtual machines using Google Engine have a host operating system set on the underlying hardware, and guest operating systems such as Linux and Windows are running on it. Therefore, the OS boot time is in the required format like a normal server.\nOn the other hand, containers do not virtualize the hardware stack like virtual machines, but virtualize at the host operating system level, and run multiple containers on the OS kernel. This makes containers much lighter than virtual machines. Therefore, containers are very fast to test and deploy.\nOption 1 is incorrect. Google Kubernetes Engine does not have the ability to automatically test source code.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Google Kubernetes Engine does not optimize the performance of virtual machines, but virtualizes and uses the computing engine in a different format than virtual machines called containers.\nOption 3 is incorrect. Even with Google Kubernetes Engine, application development requires coding.\n[Reference]\nKubernetes - Google Kubernetes Engine\uff08GKE\uff09 | Google Cloud",
        "Option 4 is the correct answer. The cost of cloud resources is pay-as-you-go for what you use, so it will vary depending on usage. Therefore, the price will not be exactly the same every month, so you should check the usage of resources and the costs incurred frequently. Since there are various cost management tools in the cloud, you can use them to visualize and notify costs.\nOption 1 is incorrect. Cloud costs can't be managed based on short-term forecasts. In the payments section of the Google Cloud console, you can see your monthly cost forecasts, but your forecasts don't always match your actual costs. It's also important to look at actual costs.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Cloud services give users the flexibility to change system costs from capital expenditures (CapEx) to operational expenditures (OpEx). It cannot be a fixed capital expenditure.\nOption 3 is incorrect. Some SLAs provide credits based on cloud downtime, but no cost is discounted.",
        "Option 4 is the correct answer. A data warehouse is a relational database that accumulates a large amount of data from multiple business systems in a company in time series and performs data analysis. You can manage structured data and analyze it to extract insights. Since one query can be processed in parallel, it demonstrates higher search and analysis performance than a normal DB. Data warehouses mainly use structured data with defined schemas such as \"customer information\" and \"product information\".\nStructured data is a collection of different types of data that is stored in a predefined format by the schema, while unstructured data is stored in its native format. When storing unstructured data, you need to use Cloud Storage, NoSQL databases, data lakes, etc.\nOption 1 is incorrect. SQL database is software that configures relational databases such as Cloud SQL. It is not used for data analysis, but for general data processing.\nOption 2 is incorrect.

When a user wants to use a Google Cloud resource, it must be placed in one of the projects. Separating projects provides a clear separation between production and development resources.\nOption 1 is incorrect. Although it is possible to isolate a virtual network by associating development resources with production resources and a separate virtual network, it is better to separate projects because they make it easier to manage resources. Also, isolating only the network does not completely isolate resources when they are in the same project.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Associating development resources with different accounts makes it difficult to collaborate when releasing development resources as production resources. It requires resource sharing and complex transfers between accounts.\nOption 4 is incorrect. A folder is one of the nodes in the Google Cloud resource hierarchy. Within the folder, there are projects and other folders. You can group projects in organization nodes in the hierarchy. Therefore, folders are too large a unit to divide a project into.\n[Reference]\nCreate and Manage Projects | Resource Manager Documentation | Google Cloud",
        "Option 1 is the correct answer. To share a virtual machine from two different projects and operate the software, you must assign the virtual machine to a single-tenant node.\nA single tenancy gives you exclusive access to a single tenant node. A sole-tenant node is a Compute Engine physical server that specializes in hosting VMs for your project. Single-tenant nodes allow you to physically isolate VMs from VMs in other projects. You can also group VMs on the same host hardware.\nOption 2 is incorrect. A single organization node can contain multiple folders and projects. Therefore, the resource must additionally assign virtual machines to the project hierarchy.\nOption 3 is incorrect. If you assign resources to multiple tenant nodes, the resources are split across multiple tenants and cannot be shared.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Bare Metal machines may have machine access to exclusive users. However, as long as the nodes are not shared, it is easier to use a single tenant machine because it can run on virtualized machines on the public cloud.\n[Reference]\nSingle Tenancy Overview | Compute Engine Documentation | Google Cloud",
        "Option 3 is the correct answer. In this scenario, the question is how to restrict all virtual machines placed in multiple folders and projects from having external IP addresses. In this way, if you want to restrict multiple resources at once across your organization, use the organization node above the projects and folders. By setting an organization policy on an organization node, you can restrict all virtual machines in the hierarchy from having external IP addresses at once.\nOrganizations can create folders and projects to create a hierarchical structure to store individual Google Cloud projects. The organization policy is a functional organization policy that imposes and manages certain rules on this folder or project. Organizational policies can impose restrictions such as not allowing people to use only certain regions or preventing them from using certain services.\nOption 1 is incorrect. Because organization policies are rules that apply to organizational hierarchies, you cannot define organization policies for accounts in Google Cloud.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Defining organizational policies for projects and applying the same rules to all resources is inefficient because you have to set definitions for each project.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Defining organizational policies for folders and applying the same rules to all resources is inefficient because you have to set the definitions for each folder.\n[Reference]\nMap your organization to GCP resource hierarchy | Google Cloud Official Blog",

        "Option 3 is the correct answer. You can monitor your application for anomalies by collecting metrics from your application and the Google Cloud resources that host your application. Collecting metrics helps you control both resource utilization and spending.\nOption 1 is incorrect. Collecting metrics alone does not provide application versioning. Version control requires the use of a development platform such as App Engine or GKE.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Collecting metrics does not automatically optimize your application. You can collect metrics to monitor for anomalous behavior and prevent problems before they happen, but automatic optimization is difficult.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Metrics collection is not intended to predict the cost of cloud resources. Resource usage fees are managed on the Google Cloud side and can be found in the Payments section of the console.\n[Reference]\nCloud Monitoring | Google Cloud",
        "Option 4 is the correct answer. Use the public cloud to scale server resources almost indefinitely, without physical constraints. One of the advantages of the cloud is its high scalability. Since the cloud can be changed on the web via the Internet, you can easily increase the number of servers you use instantly.\nOption 1 is incorrect. A private cloud is a cloud type that uses the data center and server rooms used by the company to create its own cloud environment. A private cloud provides \"additional resources to the user,\" but it is also more expensive to prepare and maintain.\nOption 2 is incorrect. On-premise is a form of server operation using a regular data center. In other words, there are physical constraints.\nOption 3 is incorrect. When using physical hardware, there are naturally physical limitations.",
        "Option 1 is the correct answer. The initial best practice for multi-departmental use of your Google Cloud environment is to define a resource hierarchy with organization resources at the top. The Organization resource, which is the root node in the Google Cloud resource hierarchy, provides centralized visibility and control across GCP resources. IAM access control policies that apply to organization resources apply to all resources throughout the hierarchy.\nOption 2 is incorrect. If you assign and maintain Google Cloud accounts for each department, many accounts will be crowded, which will complicate management.\nOption 3 is incorrect. Instead of assigning a project hierarchy by department, use the resource hierarchy of the Organization resource to divide the project.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Setting administrator privileges for all members of the company is a security concern because many members will have too much authority.\n[Reference]\nResource Hierarchy | Resource Manager Documentation | Google Cloud",

By using the cloud, you can instantly scale the performance of resources such as virtual machines by using the AutoScaling function. Cloud storage is cloud-based storage that can automatically scale capacity and performance. Cloud storage can increase unlimited capacity the more data is stored.\nOption 2 is incorrect. Cloud services give users the flexibility to change system costs from capital expenditures (CapEx) to operational expenditures (OpEx).\nOption 3 is incorrect. When using a physical data center, the transfer cost of the company's network is only the infrastructure cost because the company's network is used. When using the cloud, data transfer costs are incurred when retrieving data. Therefore, it does not reduce the cost of accessing data.\nOption 4 is incorrect. Even if redundancy using multiple data centers is used, 100% availability cannot be achieved. Even with Compute Engine's multi-zone configuration, the SLA availability that can be achieved is 99.99%.\n[Reference]\nScheduled, autoscale to get VMs ready | Google Cloud Official Blog\nCompute Engine Service Level Agreement (SLA) | Google Cloud",

        "Option 4 is the correct answer. You need to choose the virtual machine type you want to use for your workload according to your use case. Therefore, it is preferable to refine the requirements to identify the workload and then configure the virtual machine. Compute Engine offers a variety of virtual machine types to choose from depending on the different types of workloads. In general, you cannot make changes between different virtual machine types. Therefore, it is important to start with the right processor for a particular type of workload when you first start a virtual machine.\nOption 1 is incorrect. It automatically scales to the number of instances, and you can't change the individual instance type or performance.\nOption 2 is incorrect. You don't want to start with a standard-performance CPU and scale up to match the workload load. We recommend that you start with the right processor for your specific type of workload.\nOption 3 is incorrect.

        "Option 3 is the correct answer. This scenario requires lifecycle management to change the data storage location to a less frequently accessed format after one month and delete the data after 10 years. Cloud Storage provides lifecycle management such as setting an object's lifetime (TTL), retaining non-current versions, and \"downgrading\" storage classes to make it easier to manage costs.\nColdline storage is suitable for data that is read or modified only about once a quarter. However, if you want to fully retain data for backup and archiving processes, Archive storage is the most cost-effective option because it is the least expensive to store.\nInitially store data in standard storage in Cloud Storage, then migrate to Coldline storage one month later using lifecycle management. Then, based on lifecycle management, you configure the object to be deleted after 1 years.\nOptions 1 and 4 are incorrect. Archive storage is for data that is accessed less than once a year, and in this case, the data is less accessible. Archive storage is the lowest-cost, most durable storage service for data archiving, online backup, and disaster recovery. Like nearline and coldline storage, Archive storage is slightly less available than standard storage.

        "Option 2 is the correct answer. The throughput of this application is usually constant, but occasionally exceeds it. Therefore, it is possible to apply a high discount rate by using the continuous use discount.\nSustained Use Discount (SUD) is applied when a Compute Engine virtual machine is used for more than 25% of the billing month and no other discounts are applied. The Sustained Use Discount is a purchase option that allows you to purchase VMs at a higher discount rate the longer you run your VM instances in a given month. For example, a virtual machine (VM) instance that has been running continuously for one month can receive a net discount of up to 1% off resource costs. This way, if you spend more time than usual in a given month, you'll get a discount.\nOption 1 is incorrect. A committed engagement agreement is a pricing model that applies a discount by committing to a minimum tenure of one or three years. This baseline load is only constant and cannot be applied because it does not guarantee a usage period of 1 or 3 years.\nOption 3 is incorrect. Spot VM Instances (formerly Primitive VMs) are instances that are available at a much lower price (60~91% discount) than standard VM prices by temporarily providing users with space that Google holds for temporary use. Because it is temporarily borrowed capacity, Compute Engine may stop (preempt) this instance. This time, the usage time of a single VM instance is constant, but preemptible VM instances that may be stopped are not available because of the demand for overutilization discounts in a specific month.\nOption 4 is incorrect.

        "Option 3 is the correct answer. To prevent VMs and BigQuery slots from being overwhelmed by increased peak loads, reserve capacity in advance.\nWith Compute Engine and BigQuery Reservations flat rates, you can reserve capacity in advance and use it for a period of time. This allows you to apply a higher discount rate than the regular On-Demand rate.\nWith BigQuery Reservations, you can switch between on-demand and flat rates. For a flat rate, you purchase dedicated query processing capacity. By reserving capacity pools for different projects or to different departments in your organization, you can allocate purchased capacity to your entire organization.\nWith BigQuery Reservations, you get the following benefits:\n\u25a0Predictability\nWith a flat rate, the cost is fixed and predictable. You can set in advance how much you want to spend and manage costs.\n\u25a0Flexibility\nYou can choose how much space you want to buy. You're billed at a flat rate per second until you remove the capacity commitment. You can combine both billing models. For example, you can run some workloads at on-demand rates and others at a flat rate.\n\u25a0Workload Management\nAfter you purchase a slot, you can assign it to a workload. This gives your workload a dedicated pool of available BigQuery compute resources. At the same time, if a workload is only partially using its assigned slot, the unused slot is automatically shared with other workloads.\n\u25a0 Centralized purchase\nYou can purchase slots in bulk and assign them to your entire organization.
